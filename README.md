# VersOne

VersOne is a plugin that lets players cycle between different stone tools by sneaking and right-clicking the air. It maintains the damage and enchantments across the tools as they are switched.

This plugin is **experimental** and is **not intended for practical use at the moment.** This was inspired by a similar tool-switching concept I came across. Future improvements are planned & suggestions are welcome!
